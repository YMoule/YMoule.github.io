## Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) Performance Across Individuals with and without Down Syndrome (DS)

**Project description:** I am the principal investigator on this linguistics undergraduate research project and am working with Professor Zellou. This project is current in the writing stage. 

My little brother has DS. This has made me think a lot over years about what kind of things might make it easier for him to succeed. One of those tools could be ASR. ASR is a technology (like speech-to-text) that transcribes spoken word into written text. As typing can be difficult, this is a technology that can make computers more accessible for people with DS.
This led me to my research question. "Is ASR accessible and usable for people with DS?". This question has inspired a research project, investigating how accurate ASR is for people with DS and how it can be improved. Throughout this project, I have worked on planning and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, data gathering, and data cleaning and analysis.

### 1. Project Planning

As with any research project, I started by refining my research question and designing methods and measures for my data. I researched papers involving ASR and DS to gain the background knowledge relevant for this project. 

### 2. IRB Approval

As people with DS are considered a vulnerable population, I had to carefully design the consent procedures for this study. I spent a while going back and forth with the IRB before gaining project approval. This process taught me patience and perserverance. 

### 3. Gathering Data

I created flyers and sent emails to a variety of communities of people with Down Syndrome. Over the span of a couple months, I met with individuals with DS to collect their speech data. I also gathered data from individuals without DS to use as a comparison. Below, you can see a copy of the flyer.

### 4. Data Cleaning and Analysis

The speech data was transcribed by Sonix and by me. Words that were unintelligible to me where deleted from the database. Each utterance was marked as correctly (or incorrectly) transcribed. Then, the number of correctly transcribed over total utterances was used as a accuracy rate. Utterances were also given a phonetic representation to compare the type of sounds that are incorrectly transcribed. 
I am currently in the process of writing the paper and completing the analysis.
