### Data Science Projects 

- [Unlocking Lending Insights: TheLook Fintech](/TheLook)

I completed this project as the capstone project for my Google Cloud Analytics Certificate. I used multiple data sources in BigQuery to gather insight on TheLook Fintech's cash flow and customer base. In addition, I used Looker to create an interactive dashboard (below) to display key metrics, such as total balance, loan status and borrower location.

### Machine Learning Projects

- [Predicting Stock Closing Prices of MAANG
Companies using LSTM and Linear Regression](/mat128b)

This project was completed as a final project for MAT 128B at UC Davis. I created a Machine Learning model to predict future stock prices from Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (MAANG). Although the model had high performance predicting one day into the future, it failed to predict stock market trends over time. In this project, I used technical skills such as Python, PyTorch, sci-kit learn, and basic data and statistical analysis.

- [Pokémon Battle Predictions](/pokemon)

This project was completed as the final project for ECS 171 at UC Davis. I worked with a five-person team to create a Machine Learning Model to predict the winner in a Pokémon Battle. Then, I created a User Interface to make the model easy to use and access. In this project, I used technical skills such as Python, sci-kit learn, html, and basic data and statistical analysis. I also used workplace skills, such as communication, delegation, and problem solving. 

### Research Projects

- [Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) Performance Across Individuals with and without Down Syndrome](\ASR)

I am principal investigator on a linguistics research project at UC Davis, under the mentorship of Professor Zellou. I am investigating whether there is a difference in ASR performance for individuals with/without Down Syndrome. If yes, I am planning to look for particular speech sounds that ASR struggles with for all participants with Down Syndrome. This would suggest that a singular ASR system can be created for all users with Down Syndrome rather than creating an individual system for each user. As the project was started in September 2024, I am currently finishing my analysis and starting to write the paper. I planned this project and gained Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. I then met with participants to gather data. Finally, I cleaned and analyzed the data. In this project, I used technical skills such as Python, R, data cleaning, data analysis, and academic writing.
