### Data Science Projects 

- [TheLook Fintech Lending Insights](/sample_page)

I completed this project as the capstone project for my Google Cloud Analytics Certificate. I used multiple data sources in BigQuery to gather insight on TheLook Fintech's cash flow and customer base. In addition, I used Looker to create an interactive dashboard (below) to display key metrics, such as total balance, loan status and borrower location.

### Machine Learning Projects

- [Predicting Stock Closing Prices of MAANG
Companies using LSTM and Linear Regression](/mat128b)

This project was completed as a final project for MAT 128B at UC Davis. I created a Machine Learning model to predict future stock prices from Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (MAANG). Although the model had high performance predicting one day into the future, it failed to predict stock market trends over time. In this project, I used technical skills such as Python, PyTorch, sci-kit learn, and basic data and statistical analysis.
